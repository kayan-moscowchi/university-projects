This project implements a simulation model of a **newsletter dispatching system** using **Java Modeling Tools (JMT)** 
as part of the *Computer System Modeling* course.

Project Description :
The system models the dispatching of two types of news (quick news and detailed articles) through a processing pipeline and 
distribution to three social media platforms: **Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram**. The model incorporates:

- Multi-class job arrival rates using Poisson processes
- FCFS queues for image/text processing
- Fork and Join nodes for parallel media delivery
- Probabilistic routing and infinite server delay stations
- System performance metrics: **response time**, **utilization**, and **throughput**

- `.jsimg` files: JMT model implementation (requires JMT to open).
